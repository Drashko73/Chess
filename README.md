# Introduction

Since a very young age, I have enjoyed playing chess and, after embarking on my journey into the world of coding, I always wanted to create something just like this. With this coding project, I present to you a simple and easy-to-understand chess game where you can play against someone or practice moves by yourself.

The project itself is mainly written in JavaScript and, of course, has a bit of HTML and CSS for styling purposes as well. It is ideal for people who don't know how to play chess since it does not allow invalid moves, has validation procedures for every move, and offers move suggestions after picking the piece you would like to move.

# Examples and fetures

_Initial look after loading the page or after choosing **New game** option:_

_Invalid move prevention:_

Invalid moves, such as moving a piece to an unreachable position from the current one or moving a piece that is going to leave the king open to attack, are not played and are signaled with a red square and an error sound.

_Implemented famous **En-Passant** move:_

_Checkmate position recognition:_

After checkmate the game stops and needs to be restarted either by clicking the **New game** button or refreshing the page.

_Stalemate recognition:_

In case of a stalemate, the game is over and the result is Draw.

_Pawn replacement:_

# Future improvements

I know that this is just the beginning of the Chess problem and I eventually plan to implement the engine itself powered by AI. However, after having the look as it is now I feel it's going to be much smoother but we will see about that ðŸ˜Š.

_P.S. For now, I first need to learn something about the AI._
